# Jupyter docker images for nbgallery

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This repository contains Jupyter docker images designed to integrate with the [nbgallery](https://github.com/nbgallery/nbgallery) notebook collaboration platform:

  * [base-notebook](base-notebook): The new image we use in production, built on Project Jupyter's [base-notebook image](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook)
  * [alpine-notebook](alpine-notebook): A simple Jupyter image built on Alpine Linux, with no nbgallery integration.  This image is about half the size of `jupyter/base-notebook`.  We are [moving off of Alpine](https://github.com/nbgallery/jupyter-alpine#repository-status) but thought this might be useful to the community.
